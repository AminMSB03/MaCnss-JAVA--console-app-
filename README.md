# MaCnss-JAVA--console-app-

## Project background
In order to facilitate the follow-up of patients' files in Morocco, the CNSS group launched a call for tender for the creation of a console application that will be used in all the CNSS Morocco agencies network. The MaCNSS application will allow CNSS agents to easily follow the reimbursement files of each patient who is registered at CNSS.

- Each CNSS Agent has an account in the application, so that he can access the application, he must enter the email + password with a verification code sent to his email box valid (5min)

- When the patient arrives at the agency, he/she submits his/her reimbursement file, which must be made up of a CNSS form, this file is identified by the patient's number, then each patient can attach the bar code (if necessary) of each drug prescribed on the prescription

- The patient can also attach the laboratory tests

- The patient can attach a copy of the X-ray or scanner

- The CNSS agent will manually check each document and then enter all the information in the MACNSS application,

- The system will automatically indicate to the agent the amount of reimbursement for each document submitted by the patient. - Each document filed by the patient is identified by a code

- There is only one administrator in the system who will manage the CNSS agents' accounts

- Each drug has a reimbursement rate set by the CNSS management

- There are drugs that are not reimbursable by the CNSS, in this case the patient can have just the reimbursement of a medical visit

- At any time the patient can consult the history of his reimbursement files

- The reimbursement file is either: pending, refused or validated

o Pending: the file is being processed by the CNSS agent

o Refused: the patient's file is incomplete, an email is automatically sent to the patient concerned with the reason for refusal

o Validated: the file is completed and processed by the CNSS agent, in this case an email is automatically sent to the patient with the amount of reimbursement
